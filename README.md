# Random card picker (or something)

A website (or game) about choosing a random card in a rotating card carousel and looking at its content and deciding whatever the hell you want to do with it.

Built using React for no reason at all.

## Inspiration

I wanted to learn some CSS 3D transformations and I came across [this](https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/).

## Demo

Available soon.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
